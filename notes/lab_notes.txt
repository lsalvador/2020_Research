today, we look to start an analysis to see which assembly configuration results in the best
genome assembly data for M. bovis reads.

I want to take 100 random genomes from the dataset, assemble them in 4 different ways and then compare their
cumulative z-scores. This will be a supplement to the research I ultimately work on.

The scripts I designed will be used to assemble the reads using SPAdes and multi-proccessing.
