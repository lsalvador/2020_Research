#Jan 21st
today, we look to start an analysis to see which assembly configuration results in the best
genome assembly data for M. bovis reads.

I want to take 100 random genomes from the dataset, assemble them in 4 different ways and then compare their
cumulative z-scores. This will be a supplement to the research I ultimately work on.

The scripts I designed will be used to assemble the reads using SPAdes and multi-proccessing.

set up a github for my 2020 research.

via Liliana, here are some things to do:
1. Check how many genomes are missing from our repository - compare with the list of 860 isolates
-> I had 667 isolates in total, liliana had 860. after writing a script, I discovered 658 of the isolates
I had were shared between me and liliana
2. Identify from this list, the isolates chosen for your study
-> I did this and we can find the isolates in the data_i_need.txt file
3. Create script to do the download automatically in R
-> Will try to code this tonight
4. Download M. bovis genomes from NCBI
->
5. Pangenome pipelineâ€¦
-> first step is to figure out how to get the best quality. generate data with QUAST,
then plot the associated violin plots.
6. Explore mpi4python on GACRC
-> Can do the same thing with multiprocessing in python. mpi4py is not available for

#Jan 22nd
Still working on the tasks Liliana sees as important, which were stated above.

Will try and figure out how to use mpi4py to write parallel applications. trouble is that it is not on
sapelo2 cluster, so I would have to ask to download it.

in my full data folder, I have 667 pair read genomes. Match the year+ID with the new IDs that Liliana
was working with. The sequences I need are in the data_i_need.txt file.

#Jan 23rd
Today, will focus on the timeline for liliana, and coding the script for M. bovis downloads.

#Jan 27th
today, there are 3 tasks that need to be done before I can relax.
1. learn mpi4py
-> I can test my scripts on the cluster at least, but right now I am getting errors that I can't easily
answer. hopefully the GACRC will get back to me soon about how to avoid
2. web scrape SRA selector tool using R selenium.
-> So Liliana wants a tool that can check the database and see if there is anything new? and if not,
just report nothing is new. Otherwise, update the table. I will spend time on this tonight.
3. Start the outline for Pangenome Review
-> Push to tonight or tomorrow. If tomorrow I'll make this the first thing I do.
4. Try to change the names I don't have to the sequence names.
-> Will have to wait for liliana to give me the proper names.
