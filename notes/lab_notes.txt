today, we look to start an analysis to see which assembly configuration results in the best
genome assembly data for M. bovis reads.

I want to take 100 random genomes from the dataset, assemble them in 4 different ways and then compare their
cumulative z-scores. This will be a supplement to the research I ultimately work on.

The scripts I designed will be used to assemble the reads using SPAdes and multi-proccessing.

set up a github for my 2020 research.

via Liliana, here are some things to do:
1. Check how many genomes are missing from our repository - compare with the list of 860 isolates
->
2. Identify from this list, the isolates chosen for your study
->
3. Create script to do the download automatically in R
->
4. Download M. bovis genomes from NCBI
->
5. Pangenome pipelineâ€¦
-> first step is to figure out how to get the best quality. generate data with QUAST,
then plot the associated violin plots.
6. Explore mpi4python on GACRC
